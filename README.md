# Wifi Scanner
The script is a Python script that checks if the WiFi drivers are installed on an Ubuntu system, if not it installs them and loads them, then it scans for nearby WiFi networks, saves the detailed results of open networks in a file, sorts the networks by signal strength and connects to them one by one, staying connected for 10 minutes before moving to the next network.
